# TGC-Designer-Tools

Tools to support course creation and Lidar/Terrain Creation in The Golf Club 2019.

This project is still in development but is expected to release a download GUI for Windows in the new few weeks.

For course requests, priority support or feature requests, I've opened a Patreon for this project: https://www.patreon.com/chadgolf

Developers and others can look through and run the code.  The main entry points are tgc_gui, lidar_map_api, and tgc_image_terrain.

Shameless plug: I work primarily as a software consultant.  If you or your company need electronics, sensors, data processing, automation or robotics expertise, feel free to send inquiries to chad@chadev.com.  I'm part of a medium sized team and we've worked for many businesses you're familiar with, and we have a long history of success.
